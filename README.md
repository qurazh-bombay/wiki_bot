#  Wiki Telegram Bot
***

This is a demo version of telegram bot app.

On the wikipedia there is a feature - **on that day** - which returns set of historic events happened on that day.
This bot fetches those events using wiki API and returns to a user.
A user can look events on a current day or select any other date using calendar menu available in the bot.
The demo version is represented on [wikiBot](http://t.me/test181020201153Bot?start "wikiBot link").

**Note**: as the app is deployed using Heroku 'dyno' container it can take a long time to get response on first request,Â because container should be run.
